    <p>JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
        In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

        In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.</p>
    <p>
        Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

        Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

        Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

        The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:


    </p>
    <script>
        var x;
        x = 10;
        console.log(x);

        //let const cant not be used until it declared
        name = "City"
        let name ;
        //This wil throw Referance error
    </script>
</body>
